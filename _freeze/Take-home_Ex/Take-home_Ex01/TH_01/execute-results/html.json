These traditions did not merely guide spiritual life; they profoundly influenced social expectations, economic roles, and the perceived hierarchy of labor within a largely agrarian civilization.\n\nOne of the most enduring frameworks to emerge from this worldview was the concept of **\"Tứ Dân\"** (The Four Occupations - 士農工商): **\"Sĩ, Nông, Công, Thương\"**. Scholar-officials (士) occupied the highest rung, entrusted with governance and moral leadership. Farmers (农) formed the backbone of the nation, sustaining both economy and culture. Artisans (工) represented skilled productivity, while merchants (商), despite their economic importance, often occupied an ambiguous moral position due to Confucian skepticism toward profit-driven pursuits.\n\nAlthough Vietnam officially transitioned away from feudal structures in the twentieth century, culminating in national independence in 1945 and ultimate reunification in 1975, the social logic embedded within these historical classifications did not disappear overnight. Instead, they evolved into modern forms: education remains a gateway to upward mobility reminiscent of the scholar class; agriculture continues as both a cultural foundation and a persistent economic constraint; artisanal skills have transformed into small-scale informal industries; and trade and service work occupy a shifting space between opportunity and precarity.\n\nIn rural and mountainous regions, where geography, ethnic diversity, and uneven development intersect, these historical echoes still influence economic outcomes. Modern laborers are no longer bound by imperial exams or rigid caste-like roles, yet structural legacies remain visible through educational disparities, occupational segregation, and unequal access to markets and capital.\n\n**This report begins from that historical consciousness.** The data analysis presented here is not simply an analysis of numbers; it is a contemporary reflection of how centuries-old social patterns continue to shape livelihoods. By examining income structures, employment sectors, and demographic characteristics among informal rural workers, **I attempt to understand whether Vietnam has truly moved beyond the legacy of the old occupations, or whether those ancient divisions still cast long shadows over modern economic mobility.**\n\n# Foreword\n\nIn this analysis, titled **\"Beyond the Harvest: What the Fields Do Not Yield,\"** I adopt the lens of a socio-economic analyst examining the livelihoods of informal laborers in Vietnam's Northern Mountainous Region. Using a dataset of 725 rural workers, this report moves beyond simple descriptive statistics to uncover the structural \"ceilings\" and \"floors\" of rural income.\n\nI will examine how education, gender, and ethnicity interact to shape economic destiny in these developing provinces, aiming to tell a truthful and enlightening story about the barriers to upward mobility.\n\n![](images/clipboard-178225604.png)\n\n**Figure 2.

The Analysis\n\nThe northern mountainous regions of Vietnam are a tapestry of ethnic diversity and agricultural tradition. However, beneath the landscape lies a complex economic reality. The following eight visualizations deconstruct the mechanics of rural income, revealing that while agriculture remains the region's backbone, it frequently acts as a baseline of subsistence rather than a pathway to prosperity. By examining the data, we uncover how macro-geographical divides, systemic gender segregation in the workforce, and compounding ethnic disparities create steep barriers to economic mobility. More importantly, the analysis identifies the critical escape routes: formal education, occupational diversification, and targeted interventions like microfinance, which together serve as the primary ladders for transforming rural livelihoods.\n\n![](images/clipboard-2316088154.png)\n\n**Figure 3.

This provides a striking, colorblind-friendly gradient that visually separates the overlapping ridges. The `alpha` transparency ensures that peaks in the background remain visible, while gridlines were minimized to keep the focus entirely on the data contours.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the medians first\nlibrary(dplyr)\nprovince_medians <- clean_data %>%\n  group_by(Province) %>%\n  summarize(median_income = median(Income, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 6\n\nggplot(clean_data, aes(x = Income, y = reorder(Province, Income, FUN = median), fill = Province)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.7, color = \"white\", scale = 1.2, \n                      quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = province_medians, \n            aes(x = median_income, y = Province, label = paste0(round(median_income, 1), \"M\")),\n            size = 3.5, color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\",\n            nudge_y = 0.15, nudge_x = 2, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"mako\", direction = -1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Geographic Wealth Divide\",\n    subtitle = \"Income density distributions ranked across the 5 sampled provinces\",\n    x = \"Total Income (Million VND)\", \n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TH_01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Observation:**\n\nGeography plays a foundational role in earning potential. While provinces cluster around a median income of 27.5-35 Million VND, the shape of their economies differs vastly. Yen Bai trails noticeably behind with the lowest median and a highly compressed distribution, indicating widespread baseline income with few breakout earners. Conversely, Bac Giang exhibits a significantly longer and more consistent “right tail” compared to its peers.\n\nThis indicates a higher concentration of wealthy outliers, suggesting that macro-level infrastructure or proximity to trade hubs in Bac Giang dictates a higher ceiling for earning potential compared to the more constrained distributions of the northern mountainous provinces.\n\n## 3.2 The Gender Wage Gap & Occupational Segregation\n\n::: callout-note\n### Plot Approach\n\n[***Technical Approach***]{.underline}\n\nI utilized a composite layout via the `patchwork` package to connect a symptom with its cause:\n\nPlot A employs a Density Plot (`geom_density`) to show the continuous probability distribution of income between genders.\n\nPlot B employs a 100% Stacked Bar Chart (`geom_bar(position = \"fill\")`) to show the proportional makeup of job sectors for each gender.\n\n[***Visual Rationale***]{.underline}\n\nFor Plot A, transparency (alpha = 0.6) allows the viewer to see exactly where the female distribution is \"swallowed\" by the male distribution. I used high-contrast `Navy` and `Red` for gender to make the distinction immediate. For Plot B, a warm `YlOrBr` palette differentiates job sectors, creating visual harmony without confusing the colors used for gender.\n:::\n\n![](images/clipboard-318702080.png)\n\n**Figure 4.

This near-doubling effectively raises the baseline \"floor\" of earnings, as the bottom 25th percentile of Upper Secondary earners still outpaces the median of Lower Secondary earners. Notably, the Upper Secondary cohort possesses a much wider interquartile range and the highest maximum income outliers (stretching past 200M VND).\n\nThis indicates that reaching formal upper secondary education unlocks access to a much broader spectrum of higher-paying opportunities.

Modern Vietnam at night**\n\n(Source: The Internet)\n\n# 4. Food for Thought & Conclusion: Beyond the Modern Occupations\n\nIf history once divided society into **the Four Occupations**, today’s rural economy appears to operate under a quieter but equally powerful classification system: one shaped by education, geography, gender, ethnicity, and access to capital. The dataset reveals that while Vietnam has long moved beyond its feudal structure in law and governance, the echoes of historical hierarchies continue to shape how labor is valued and rewarded. Agriculture, once the moral backbone of society, now functions less as a path to stability and more as a tightly capped baseline of survival. Meanwhile, education and occupational diversification, the modern equivalents of social mobility, serve as the necessary gateways to prosperity.\n\n**Yet the data complicates any simplistic narrative of progress.** Education does raise incomes, but its function fractures along ethnic lines: for the Kinh majority, it provides a reliable economic safety net, whereas for ethnic minorities, it acts as a high-stakes gamble defined by extreme variance. The modern shift away from agriculture into services and trade is the undeniable engine of top-tier wealth. However, this transition is not a universal equalizer; paradoxically, women have diversified out of agriculture at higher rates than men, yet remain disproportionately trapped beneath the wage ceilings of those very same sectors. Furthermore, while interventions like microcredit introduce crucial mid-level entrepreneurial mobility, the data explicitly shows that the absolute highest economic strata are occupied almost entirely by self-funded households who have outgrown the need for leverage.\n\nThe deeper lesson emerging from this analysis is that upward mobility is rarely the result of a single intervention. Instead, it is the product of intersecting advantages: education that unlocks non-agricultural work, capital that enables risk-taking, and structural conditions that allow individuals to step beyond inherited demographic roles. Where these forces align, we see income ceilings shatter and new pathways emerge. Where they do not, individuals remain trapped within invisible boundaries that resemble the old social categories, only now hidden beneath modern economic terminology.\n\n**Ultimately, “Beyond the Harvest: What the Fields Do Not Yield”** is not simply about income differences among rural laborers. It is a reflection on how historical mindsets, structural inequalities, and contemporary economic forces converge to shape the lived realities of Vietnam’s most vulnerable populations. The question facing policymakers and development practitioners is not whether rural communities can produce more from the land, but whether systems can be built that allow individuals to move beyond it, without abandoning the cultural and social foundations that define rural life.\n\nIn a country whose past once ranked citizens by occupation, the modern challenge lies in ensuring that occupation no longer determines destiny. True progress will not be measured solely by increased harvests or rising averages, but by whether the next generation of rural laborers can choose their paths freely, unbound by the quiet hierarchies that history left behind.\n\n# 5.
